# cot-4500-as3b
## What it Does:
This code performs two main functions. The first is a Gaussian elimination with a backwards substitution to solve a linear system. This linear system is set up as an augmented matrix. The second function is a LU Factorization that prints out matrix determinant, the L matrix, and the U matrix. 

## How it works:
The functions are coded under main/assignment_3.py. I import the functions into test/test_assignment_3.py where I then run the test cases.

## Running the Code:
For running the test file, cd into the folder that contains both main and test folders and use "python -m test.test_assignment_3".
